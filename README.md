# PhotonDebloater
## CURRENTLY IN BETA! PROBABLY WILL NOT WORK! NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE! ANY DAMAGE DONE IS NOT MY FAULT, YOU AS THE USER IS DOWNLOADING AND RUNNING THE SCRIPT, SO IT IS RECOMMENDED TO CHECK ALL SCRIPTS BEFORE RUNNING.
    - NEVER, NEVER EVER, run random scripts from the internet, even if you trust the author, always make sure to do a thorough check of what the script does. Even for normal home users, reading PowerShell scripts should be   easy. At least it is easier to spend some time doing that, than wasting 1 hour of your life reinstalling Windows because of damage done to it. Back up your data at all times, and make a restore point.
## This tool aims to allow the user to debloat thier install of Windows. It should be able to work on both Windows 11 && Windows 10.

### Features:
  - Allows user to make custom selection of what UWP Garbage to uninstall
  - Allows for building custom WIM file of Windows 10/11 before installation.
  - Very buggy! Good for people who like to report bugs.

### For bug testers: Recommended to test in a Virtual Machine.
  - As always, contributions are always welcome. This is probably going to be my first actually useful, real, project that I'm commiting to GitHub.
